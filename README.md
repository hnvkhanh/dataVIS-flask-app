## Practice using Flask and Plotly to visualize datasets

To make this web app up and running, first, you need to download the dataset(s) and put them into the `datasets` folder (it is an empty folder that I have created for you, so you will not need to wonder where to put this folder).

Until now I have only visualized one dataset (Life Expectancy - WHO).

You can download this dataset at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). For this data, you need to name it `Life Expectancy Data.csv`, or you have to change the config in `app.py`.

I also provided a Jupyter Notebook, I do exactly the same work of visualization with this notebook as I have done with the web app. It is merely that you can choose which type of information you want to see in web app with UI.
