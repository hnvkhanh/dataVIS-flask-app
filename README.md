## Practice using Flask and Plotly to visualize datasets

To make this web up and running, first you need to download the dataset(s) and put them into `datasets` folder (it is an empty folder that I have created for you, so you will not need to wonder where to put this folder).

Until now I have only visualized one dataset (Life Expectancy - WHO).

You can down load this dataset at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
